This directory contains content displayed by `README.md`. URLs in `README.md` cannot be relative, as the content is served in different domains (locally, GitHub, PyPi, etc.). When making updates to the content in this directory, ensure that the content is modified here. Then, use GitHub's web editor to modify `README.md` by dragging the files into the markdown. GitHub will then upload the content to its asset storage location, which can be accessed across different domains.

View this file's history for an example of the changes made when updating new content.
